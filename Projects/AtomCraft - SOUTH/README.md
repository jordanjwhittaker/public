AtomCraft – Plasma Diagnostics Team Lead & Integration Engineer

AtomCraft is a start-up-like project of 80+ students with mission of creating the first student-designed, built and operated Tokamak for use in Fusion & Plasma research at UNSW.

As Integration Engineer and Plasma Diagnostics Team Lead, I design, build and integrate plasma diagnostics devices such as Langmuir Probes, spectrometers and Rogowski coils and manage technical integration across sub-systems. I designed and implemented development and testing processes to support subsystem integration of the 80+ students, optimising for ergonomics, reliability, traceability, and cross-team compatibility.

Applied skills – Team/project management, vacuum vessel design, CAD modelling, plasma simulation, metal manufacturing techniques, circuit/electronics design and manufacture/integration, data analysis, purchasing, safety/engineering documentation, design documentation/communication processes.
