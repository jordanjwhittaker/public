Automated leak detection device for nuclear waste capsules

Designed and modelled a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) to power an automated leak detection device for nuclear waste capsules in deep geological repositories. The device utilised latent heat from nuclear waste to power diagnostics and relay data through low-frequency magnetic induction. Chosen for an across-university engineering showcase presentation.

Applied skills â€“ CAD modelling, thermal simulations, electromagnetism, radiation containment, research.

Final result of 85 (HD).
