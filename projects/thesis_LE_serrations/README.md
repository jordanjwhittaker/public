Honours Thesis – Aerodynamic Investigation of Leading-Edge Serrations

Conducting a computational and experimental investigation into the design of leading-edge serrations on wings and how their properties affect aerodynamic performance. Utilising Python APIs within ANSYS Workbench to automate tens of thousands of CFD simulations then experimentally verifying results using a wind tunnel.

Applied skills – Parametric CAD and CFD (ANSYS Workbench/Fluent), system automation, HPC Katana cluster, 3D printing, research, data analysis and use of wind tunnel.

Thesis A result of 92 (HD).
